# Marathon C: Game Development from the Beginning
Welcome to the Marathon C repository. This repository follows my journey in Sprint 1 all the way to Endgame, in which I tackled more difficult exercises in C programming, algorithms, software engineering, and game development.

# ðŸ“Œ Overview
This archive includes all of the Marathon C program exercises and solutions completed along the course of the program. The process starts with basic C programming exercises and proceeds to data structures, algorithms, system programming, and finally, game development.

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Ubuntu
Programming Language: C
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Tools used: GCC, Valgrind, SDL (for game development)

# ðŸš€ Important Points of Emphasis & Observations
Solid problem-solving capability based on algorithmic exercises
Background in system-level programming and optimization for performance
Hands-on game creation, implementation, and testing
Importance of code structure, collaboration, and version control
